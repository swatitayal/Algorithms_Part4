### Problem 1: 
Given a singly linked list, find middle of the linked list. If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to print second middle element.

For example:
if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then output should be 3. 
if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then output should be 4.

### Problem 2: 
Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list. 

For example: if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40.

### Problem 3: 
Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).

If a linked list is given as 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->NULL and k = 3 then output will be 3->2->1->6->5->4->8->7->NULL.

### Problem 4: 
Given a linked list, check if the the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

### Problem 5: 
Given a linked list, the task is to find the n'th node from the end.

### Problem 6: 
Given two linked lists sorted in ascending order. Merge them in-place and return head of the merged list. It is strongly recommended to do merging in-place using O(1) extra space.  

For example: if first list is 10->20->30 and second list is 15->17, then the result list should be 10->15->17->20->30.

### Problem 7: 
Given a Linked List where every node represents a linked list and contains two pointers of its type:
(i) a next pointer to the next node
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.

You have to flatten the linked list so that the resultant list is sorted.

### Problem 8: 
Given a singly linked list, write a function to swap elements pairwise. 

For example: if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->5, 
and 
if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5.

### Problem 9: 
Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns sum list. The sum list is list representation of addition of two input numbers.

### Problem 10: 
 Given a singly linked list of integers, Your task is to complete the function isPalindrome that returns true if the given list is palindrome, else returns false.
